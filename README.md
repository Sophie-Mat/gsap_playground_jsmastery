# ðŸŽ¨ GSAP Practice Playground

As I'm learning GSAP, I found [Adrian Hajdinâ€™s original repo](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/jsmastery_gsap_course_playground) incredibly helpful. It provides:

âœ… Pre-built HTML & CSS for each lesson 

âœ… Empty JS files for animation practice 

âœ… Challenge folders for extra hands-on experience

This repo is my personal workspace where Iâ€™m adding GSAP animations as I progress through the course. All original structure and styling remain unchanged â€” my contributions are focused on the JavaScript files.

## âœ¨ Animations Included

Here are the types of animations Iâ€™m currently implementing as part of the course:

-   Basic entrance animations using `gsap.to()`, `gsap.from()`, and `gsap.fromTo()`
    
-   Instant style/state changes with `gsap.set()`
    
-   Easing techniques including Power, Sine, Back, Bounce, Elastic, and Expo
    
-   Apple Dock-style effects with responsive scaling and motion
    
-   Scroll-triggered animations for dynamic page interactions
    
-   Timeline-based sequences for orchestrated multi-step animations
    
-   Challenge solutions like pulsing glows, interactive reveals, and springy transitions
    

Along the way, Iâ€™m also learning how to animate various properties and use GSAPâ€™s methods to control timing, flow, and interactivity.

Thanks to Adrian Hajdin for the fantastic starter repo and course!
